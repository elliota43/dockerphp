# Introduction
**Docker Image for Symfony 4.3+ Application** running **Nginx + PHP FPM** based on [PHP](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) & [Nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) **Alpine Official Images**.

This is a pre-configured template image for your Symfony Project, **and you shall extend and edit it according to your app requirements.**
The Image utilizes docker's multistage builds to create multiple targets optimized for **production** and **development**.

You should copy this repository`Dockerfile`, `docker` Directory, `Makefile`, and `.dockerignore` to your Symfony application repository and configure it to your needs.

### Main Points üìú

- Multi-Container setup with `Nginx` & `PHP-FPM` communicating via TCP.

- Production Images is **immutable** and **fully contained Image** with source code and dependencies inside, Development image is set up for mounting source code on runtime with hot-reload.

- Image configuration is transparent, all configuration and default configurations that determine app behavior are present in the image directory.

- Nginx is pre-configured with **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, and **HTTP2**. and uses a self-signed certificate generated at build-time. For production, you'll need to mount your own signed certificates to `/etc/nginx/ssl/server.(crt/key)`.

- The image has set up **healthchecks** for `Nginx` and `PHP-FPM`, and you can add application logic healthcheck by adding it in `healthcheck.sh`[üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/symdocker/blob/master/docker/healthcheck.sh).

- Image tries to fail at build time as much as possible by running all sort of Checks.

- Dockerfile is arranged for optimizing prod builds so that changes won't invalidate cache as much as possible.

- Available a `Supervisord` and `Crond` image variant for your consumers and cron commands.

# Setup

#### 1. Add Template to your repo.

1. Download This Repository
2. Copy `Dockerfile`, `docker` Directory, `Makefile`, and `.dockerignore` Into your Symfony Application Repository.

OR

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16992394/65464461-20c95880-de5a-11e9-9bf0-fc79d125b99e.png" alt="create repository from template"></a>

#### 2. Start
1. Modify `Dockerfile` to your app needs, and add your app needed PHP Extensions and Required Packages.
2. Go to `docker/.composer/.env` and modify `SERVER_NAME` to your app's name.
3. Run `make up` for development or `make deploy` for production. 
4. Go to [https://localhost](https://localhost) 

> Makefile is just a wrapper over docker-compose commands.

> Production runs on port `80` and `443`, Development runs on `8080` and `443`.
      
# Building and Extending Image 

1. The image is to be used as a base for your Symfony application image, you should modify its Dockerfile to your needs.

2. The image comes with a handy _Makefile_ to build the image using Docker-Compose files, it's handy when manually building the image for development or in a not-orchestrated docker host.
However, in an environment where CI/CD pipelines will build the image, they will need to supply some build-time arguments for the image. (tho defaults exist.)

### Build Time Arguments
| **ARG**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                      | **Default** |

> All Images are **Alpine** based.  Official PHP-Alpine-CLI image size is 79.4MB. 

> Size stated above are calculated excluding source code and vendor directory. 

## Tips for building Image in different environments

### Production
1. For SSL: Mount your signed certificates as secrets to `/etc/nginx/ssl/server.key` & `/etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt`
2. Make sure build argument `SERVER_NAME` matches certificate's **common name**.
2. Expose container port `80` and `443`.    

> By default, Image has a generated self-signed certificate for SSL connections added at build time.
### Development
1. Mount source code root to `/var/www/app`
2. Expose container port `8080` and `443`. (or whatever you need actually)

----

# Configuration

## 1. PHP Extensions, Dependencies, and Configuration

### Modify PHP Configuration
1. PHP `prod` Configuration  `docker/conf/php/php-prod.ini`[üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/symdocker/blob/master/docker/conf/php/php-prod.ini) 
2. PHP `dev` Configuration  `docker/conf/php/php-dev.ini`[üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/symdocker/blob/master/docker/conf/php/php-dev.ini) 
3. PHP additional [Symfony recommended configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/performance.html#configure-opcache-for-maximum-performance) at `docker/conf/php/symfony.ini` [üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/symdocker/blob/master/docker/conf/php/symfony.ini) 

### Add Packages needed for PHP runtime
Add Packages needed for PHP runtime in this section of the `Dockerfile`.
```Dockerfile
...
# ------------------------------------- Install Packages Needed Inside Base Image --------------------------------------
RUN apk add --no-cache    \
#    # - Please define package version too ---
#    # -----  Needed for Image----------------
   fcgi tini \
#    # -----  Needed for PHP -----------------
    <HERE>
...
``` 

### Add & Enable PHP Extensions
Add PHP Extensions using `docker-php-ext-install <extensions...>` or `pecl install <extensions...>`  and Enable them by `docker-php-ext-enable <extensions...>`
in this section of the `Dockerfile`.
```Dockerfile
...
# --------------------- Install / Enable PHP Extensions ------------------------
RUN docker-php-ext-install opcache && pecl install memcached && docker-php-ext-enable memcached
...
```

##### Note

> At build time, Image will run `composer check-platform-reqs` to check that PHP and extensions versions match the platform requirements of the installed packages.

## 2. Nginx Configuration

Nginx defaults are all defined in `docker/conf/nginx/` [üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/symdocker/blob/master/docker/conf/nginx/)

Nginx is pre-configured with:
1. HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP2.
2. Rate limit (`rate=5r/s`)
3. Access & Error logs to `stdout/err`
4. Recommended Security Headers
5. Serving Static content with default cache `7d`
6. Metrics endpoint at `:8080/stub_status` from localhost only.

##### Note

> At build time, Image will run `nginx -t` to check config file syntax is OK.

## 3. Post Deployment Custom Scripts

Post Installation scripts should be configured in `composer.json` in the `post-install-cmd` [part](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#command-events).

However, Sometimes, some packages have commands that need to be run on startup, that are not compatible with composer, provided in the image a shell script `post-deployment.sh`[üîó](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/symdocker/blob/master/docker/post-deployment.sh) that will be executed after deployment. 
Special about this file that it comes loaded with all OS Environment variables **as well as defaults from `.env` and `.env.${APP_ENV}` files.** so it won't need a special treatment handling parameters.

> It is still discouraged to be used if it's possible to run these commands using composer scripts.

## 3. Supervisor Consumers

If you have consumers (e.g rabbitMq or Kafka consumers) that need to be run under supervisor, you can define these at `docker/conf/supervisor/*`, which will run by the `supervisor` image target.

## 4. Cron Commands

If you have cron jobs, you can define them in `docker/conf/crontab`, which will run by the `cron` image target.

# Misc Notes
- Your application [should log app logs to stdout.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38499825/symfony-logs-to-stdout-inside-docker-container). Read about [12factor/logs](https://12factor.net/logs) 
- By default, `php-fpm` access & error logs are disabled as they're mirrored on `nginx`, this is so that `php-fpm` image will contain **only** application logs written by PHP.
- During Build, Image will run `composer dump-autoload` and `composer dump-env` to optimize for performance.
- In **production**, Image contains source-code, however, you must sync both `php-fpm` and `nginx` images so that they contain the same code.

# Contribution

PR(s) are Open and welcomed.

This image has so little to do with Symfony itself and more with Setting up a PHP Website with Nginx and FPM, hence it can be extended for other PHP Frameworks (e.g Laravel, etc). maybe if you're interested to build a similar image for another framework we can collaborate. 

### Possible Ideas

- [x] Add a slim image with supervisor for running consumers.
- [x] Add a slim image with cron tab for cron job instances.
- [ ] Add node build stage that compiles javascript.
- [ ] Recreate the image for Symfony 3^
- [ ] Recreate the image for Laravel
